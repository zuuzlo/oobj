This is my version of an oop to complete a Tealeaf Academy assignment

I wanted the user to experiance blackjack simular to a casino.
With that in mind it is a multiple player game which you can play multiple hands.  
There up to six player spots which could be occupied by seperate persons or multiple hands by one person or both.
If a deal hits a natural blackjack A + 10,J,Q or K there will be no action and the best you can do is tie.  
Player blackjack pays 1.5 to 1.

You can double down on any two cards.

You can split any two liked cards into two hands.

If you don't have the money in your bankroll to doubledown or split cards the option will not be presented.

You can continue to keep playing after each hand.
